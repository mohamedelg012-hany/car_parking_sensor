Objective: 
The aim of this project is to design a simple car parking sensor system that 
helps drivers detect obstacles and avoid collisions while parking. The system 
measures the distance between the car and an obstacle using an ultrasonic 
sensor and displays the distance on an LCD screen. LEDs and a buzzer 
provide visual and auditory warnings based on the proximity of the object. 

Overview: 
This project uses an ATmega32 microcontroller to process distance data 
from an ultrasonic sensor and display the results on an LCD. The system 
includes three LEDs (Red, Green, and Blue) and a buzzer for indicating the 
proximity of an obstacle. The LEDs light up progressively and the buzzer 
activates as the obstacle gets closer, helping drivers park safely.
